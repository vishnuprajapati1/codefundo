A disaster is an event or series of events that leads to sudden disruption of normal life, causing severe damage to life and property to an extent, that available social and economic protection mechanism are inadequate to cope. 

Disasters could be, natural (geological, hydro-meteorological and biological) or induced by human processes (environmental degradation and technological hazards).

While we cannot prevent an earthquake or a hurricane from occurring, or a volcano from erupting, we can apply the scientific knowledge and technical know-how to issue early warnings on volcanoes and cyclones and organize proper community response to such warnings.


Application of technology in disaster management 

Though it is not possible to completely avoid the natural disasters, but the sufferings can be minimized by creating proper awareness of the likely disasters and its impact by developing a suitable warning system, disaster preparedness and management of disasters through application of information technology tools.

There are mainly applications we can use to manage disasters: 

• Internet 

In the present era of electronic communication, the internet provides a useful platform for disaster mitigation communications. Launching of a well-defined website is a very cost-effective means of making an intra-national and international presence felt. It provides a new and potentially revolutionary option for the rapid, automatic, and global dissemination of disaster information. A number of individuals and groups, including several national meteorological services, are experimenting with the Internet for real-time dissemination of weather observation, forecasts, satellite and other data. In the most critical phase of natural disasters electronic communication have provided the most effective and in some instances perhaps the only means of communication with the outside world. 

• Warning and forecasting system

An advance system of forecasting, monitoring and issuing early warnings plays the most significant role in determining whether a natural hazard will assume disastrous proportions or not. 

IMD provides cyclone warnings from the Area Cyclone Warning Centers (ACWCs) It has developed the necessary infrastructure to originate and disseminate the cyclone warnings at appropriate levels. It has made operational a satellite based communication system called Cyclone Warning Dissemination System for direct dissemination of cyclone warnings to the cyclone prone coastal areas. 

Seismological observations in the country are made through national network of 36 seismic stations operated by the IMD, which is the nodal agency. 

These stations have collected data over long periods of time. 

Flood forecasts and warnings are issued by the Central Water Commission (CWC) , Ministry of Water Resources. These are used for alerting the public and for taking appropriate measures by concerned administrative and state engineering agencies in the flood hazard mitigation. Information is gathered from the CWC's vast network of Forecasting Stations on various rivers in the country.
What we ca actually do is sending alert messages to the people residing in the extended area where there is a possibility of a disaster.
